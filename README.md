This programm, simulates two ideal blocks, which are frictionless, perfectly elastic so that there are no loss in energy when they collide.
It's true that if they were to be idealthere would be no sound when they collide, but the sound makes it more fun. 
The left wall and the ground are also frictionless and perfectly elastic.
A counter counts the total number of collision, it does not matter if the collision is between the squares or the wall. 
Pressing the Space tab will reset the experiment and increase the mass of the bigger block.
They start with the same mass a ratio 1:1.
2nd experiment has a ratio 100 to 1.
3rd experiment has a ratio 10 000 to 1.
4th experiment has a ratio 1 million to 1.
5th experiment has a ratio 100 million to 1.
6th experiment has a ratio 10 billion    to 1.
7th experiment has a ratio 1 trillion      to 1.
Unfortunately the programm breaks here.

You need a wav soundfile, https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/tools/ , i suggest Metal hammer hit, something short. 
Than paste the file path  click_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound('File _ Path) or disable 3 lines which are commented like this  #!!!!!!!!!!, for no sound.
